Feedback by Jonas Fietz: 

Grade: 5.5


General: I like the approach of clear definition, statement, then explanation. 

Q1)  2.5 / 2.5: You miss the aspect of the end-to-end in your definition that is is permissible for performance increase, even though you imply it by leaving out "only". I would have liked to see the connection to the specific question asked. 

Q2) 1 / 1: Perfect

Q3) 2 / 2: You were not necessarily supposed to choose one over the other. Some more explanation on what each mean would have been good.
