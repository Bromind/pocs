Principles of computer systems.
-------------------------------

POCS is a graduate research-oriented course at EPFL. Each week, we have to read two papers on various wide applicable principles, in the domain of computer systems. Moreover, During the semester, we are asked to write 9 one-pagers, which are short proposals on a particular question related to the week subject.

Regularly, we also have the opportunity to do short presentations (5 min) to the class on papers related to the previous weeks.

This repository contains the one pagers I wrote, as well as the presentation slides, and is updated every Friday, after the one-pager deadline. It also contains professor feedbacks on the one-pagers, to emphasize the fact that they are not peer-reviewed published material, and hence contains some mistakes.
